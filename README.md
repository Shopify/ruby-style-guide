# Ruby style guide

Ruby is the main language at Shopify. We are primarily a Ruby shop and we are
probably one of the largest out there. Ruby is the go-to language for new web
projects and scripting.

We expect all developers at Shopify to have at least a passing understanding of
Ruby. It's a great language. It will make you a better developer no matter what
you work in day to day. What follows is a loose coding style to follow while
developing in Ruby.


## General

* Make all lines of your methods operate on the same level of abstraction.
  (Single Level of Abstraction Principle)

* Code in a functional way. Avoid mutation (side effects) when you can.

* Do not program defensively (see
  [http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml#HDR11](http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml#HDR11)).

* Do not mutate arguments unless that is the purpose of the method.

* Do not mess around in / monkeypatch core classes when writing libraries.

* Keep the code simple.

* Don't overdesign.

* Don't underdesign.

* Avoid bugs.

* Be consistent.

* Use common sense.


## Formatting

* Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding.

* Use 2 space indent, no tabs.

* Use Unix-style line endings.

* Don't use `;` to separate statements and expressions. As a corollary - use one
  expression per line.

* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons, around
  `{` and before `}`.

* No spaces after `(`, `[` and before `]`, `)`.

* No space after the `!` operator.

* No space inside range literals.

* Indent `when` as deep as the `case` line.

* When assigning the result of a conditional expression to a variable, align its
  branches with the variable that receives the return value.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  result =
    if some_cond
      # ...
      # ...
      calc_something
    else
      calc_something_else
    end

  # good
  result = if some_cond
    # ...
    # ...
    calc_something
  else
    calc_something_else
  end
  ~~~

* Use empty lines between method definitions and also to break up methods into
  logical paragraphs internally.

* Use spaces around the `=` operator when assigning default values to method
  parameters.

* Avoid line continuation `\` where not required. In practice, avoid using line
  continuations for anything but string concatenation.

* Align the parameters of a method call, if they span more than one line, with
  one level of indentation relative to the start of the line with the method
  call.

  ~~~ ruby
  # starting point (line is too long)
  def send_mail(source)
    Mailer.deliver(to: 'bob@example.com', from: 'us@example.com', subject: 'Important message', body: source.text)
  end

  # bad (double indent)
  def send_mail(source)
    Mailer.deliver(
        to: 'bob@example.com',
        from: 'us@example.com',
        subject: 'Important message',
        body: source.text)
  end

  # good
  def send_mail(source)
    Mailer.deliver(
      to: 'bob@example.com',
      from: 'us@example.com',
      subject: 'Important message',
      body: source.text,
    )
  end
  ~~~

* When chaining methods on multiple lines, indent successive calls by one level of indentation.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad (indented to the previous call)
  User.pluck(:name)
      .sort(&:casecmp)
      .chunk { |n| n[0] }

  # good
  User
    .pluck(:name)
    .sort(&:casecmp)
    .chunk { |n| n[0] }
  ~~~

* Align the elements of array literals spanning multiple lines.

* Limit lines to 120 characters.

* Avoid trailing whitespace.

* End each file with a newline.

* Don't use block comments:

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  =begin
  comment line
  another comment line
  =end

  # good
  # comment line
  # another comment line
  ~~~


## Syntax

* Use `::` only to reference constants(this includes classes and modules) and
  constructors (like `Array()` or `Nokogiri::HTML()`). Do not use `::` for
  regular method invocation.

* Use def with parentheses when there are parameters. Omit the parentheses when
  the method doesn't accept any parameters.

* Never use `for`, unless you know exactly why.

* Never use `then`.

* Favor the ternary operator(`?:`) over `if/then/else/end` constructs.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  result = if some_condition then something else something_else end

  # good
  result = some_condition ? something : something_else
  ~~~

* Use one expression per branch in a ternary operator. This also means that
  ternary operators must not be nested. Prefer if/else constructs in these
  cases.

* Use `when x then ...` for one-line cases.

* Use `!` instead of `not`.

* Prefer `&&`/`||` over `and`/`or`.
  [More info on `and/or` for control flow](http://devblog.avdi.org/2014/08/26/how-to-use-rubys-english-andor-operators-without-going-nuts/).

* Avoid multiline `?:` (the ternary operator); use `if/unless` instead.

* Favor modifier `if/unless` usage when you have a single-line body.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  if some_condition
    do_something
  end

  # good
  do_something if some_condition
  ~~~

* Favor `unless` over `if` for negative conditions.

* Do not use `unless` with `else`. Rewrite these with the positive case first.

* Omit parentheses around parameters for methods that are part of an internal
  DSL (e.g. Rake, Rails, RSpec), methods that have "keyword" status in Ruby
  (e.g. `attr_reader`, `puts`) and attribute access methods. Use parentheses
  around the arguments of all other method invocations.

* Use class methods instead of a rails scope with a multi-line lambda

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  scope(:pending, lambda do
    ...
    ...
  end)

  # good
  def self.pending
    ...
    ...
  end
  ~~~

* Omit the outer braces around an implicit options hash.

* Use the proc invocation shorthand when the invoked method is the only
  operation of a block.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  names.map { |name| name.upcase }

  # good
  names.map(&:upcase)
  ~~~

* Prefer `{...}` over `do...end` for single-line blocks. Avoid using `{...}` for
  multi-line blocks. Always use `do...end` for "control flow" and "method
  definitions" (e.g. in Rakefiles and certain DSLs). Avoid `do...end` when
  chaining.

* Avoid `return` where not required for control flow.

* Avoid `self` where not required (it is only required when calling a self
  write accessor).

* Using the return value of `=` is okay:

  ~~~ ruby
  if v = /foo/.match(string) ...
  ~~~

* Use `||=` to initialize variables only if they're not already initialized.

* Don't use `||=` to initialize boolean variables (consider what would happen if
  the current value happened to be `false`).

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad - would set enabled to true even if it was false
  @enabled ||= true

  # good
  @enabled = true if enabled.nil?

  # also valid - defined? workaround
  @enabled = true unless defined?(@enabled)
  ~~~

* Do not put a space between a method name and the opening parenthesis.

* Use the new lambda literal syntax for single-line body blocks. Use the lambda
  method for multi-line blocks.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  l = lambda { |a, b| a + b }
  l.call(1, 2)

  # good
  l = ->(a, b) { a + b }
  l.call(1, 2)

  l = lambda do |a, b|
    tmp = a * 7
    tmp * b / 50
  end
  ~~~

* Prefer `proc` over `Proc.new`.

* Prefix with `_` unused block parameters and local variables. It's also
  acceptable to use just `_`.

* Prefer a guard clause when you can assert invalid data. A guard clause is a
  conditional statement at the top of a function that bails out as soon as it
  can.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  def compute_thing(thing)
    if thing[:foo]
      update_with_bar(thing)
      if thing[:foo][:bar]
        partial_compute(thing)
      else
        re_compute(thing)
      end
    end
  end

  # good
  def compute_thing(thing)
    return unless thing[:foo]
    update_with_bar(thing[:foo])
    return re_compute(thing) unless thing[:foo][:bar]
    partial_compute(thing)
  end
  ~~~

* Avoid hashes-as-optional-parameters in general. Does the method do too much?

* Prefer keyword arguments over options hash.

* Prefer `map` over `collect`, `find` over `detect`, `select` over `find_all`,
  `size` over `length`.


## Naming

* Use `snake_case` for symbols, methods and variables.

* Use `CamelCase` for classes and modules (keep acronyms like HTTP, RFC, XML
  uppercase).

* Use `snake_case` for naming files and directories, e.g. `hello_world.rb`.

* Aim to have just a single class/module per source file. Name the file name
  as the class/module, but replacing `CamelCase` with `snake_case`.

* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for other constants.

* When using inject with short blocks, name the arguments according to what is
  being injected, e.g. `|hash, e|` (mnemonic: hash, element)

* When defining binary operators, name the parameter `other`(`<<` and `[]` are
  exceptions to the rule, since their semantics are different).

* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value) should
  end in a question mark (i.e. `Array#empty?`). Methods that don't return a
  boolean, shouldn't end in a question mark.


## Comments

* Good comments focus on the reader of the code, by helping them understand the code. The reader may not have the same understanding, experience and knowledge as you. As a writer, take this into account.

* A big problem with comments is that they can get out of sync with the code easily. When refactoring code, refactor the surrounding comments as well.

* Write good copy, and use proper capitalization and punctuation.

* Focus on **why** your code is the way it is if this is not obvious, not **how** your code works.

* Avoid superfluous comments. If they are about how your code works, should you clarify your code instead?

* For a good discussion on the costs and benefits of comments, see
  [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CommentCostsAndBenefits](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CommentCostsAndBenefits).


## Classes & Modules

* Prefer modules to classes with only class methods. Classes should be used
  only when it makes sense to create instances out of them.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  module SomeModule
    module_function

    def some_method
    end

    def some_other_method
    end
  end

  # good
  module SomeModule
    extend self

    def some_method
    end

    def some_other_method
    end
  end
  ~~~

* Favor the use of `extend self` over `module_function` when you want to turn a
  module's instance methods into class methods.

* Use a `class << self` block over `def self.` when defining class methods, and
  group them together within a single block.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  class SomeClass
    def self.method1
    end

    def method2
    end

    private

    def method3
    end

    def self.method4 # this is actually not private
    end
  end

  # good
  class SomeClass
    class << self
      def method1
      end

      private

      def method4
      end
    end

    def method2
    end

    private

    def method3
    end
  end
  ~~~

* When designing class hierarchies make sure that they conform to the [Liskov
  Substitution
  Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle).

* Use the [`attr` family of methods](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Module.html#method-i-attr_accessor)
  to define trivial accessors or mutators.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  class Person
    def initialize(first_name, last_name)
      @first_name = first_name
      @last_name = last_name
    end

    def first_name
      @first_name
    end

    def last_name
      @last_name
    end
  end

  # good
  class Person
    attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

    def initialize(first_name, last_name)
      @first_name = first_name
      @last_name = last_name
    end
  end
  ~~~

* Avoid the use of `attr`. Use `attr_reader` and `attr_accessor` instead.

* Avoid the usage of class (`@@`) variables due to their "nasty" behavior in
  inheritance.

* Indent the `public`, `protected`, and `private` methods as much as the method
  definitions they apply to. Leave one blank line above the visibility modifier
  and one blank line below in order to emphasize that it applies to all methods
  below it.

  ~~~ ruby
  class SomeClass
    def public_method
      # ...
    end

    private

    def private_method
      # ...
    end

    def another_private_method
      # ...
    end
  end
  ~~~

* Avoid `alias` when `alias_method` will do.


## Exceptions

* Signal exceptions using the `raise` method.

* Don't specify `RuntimeError` explicitly in the two argument version of
  `raise`.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  raise RuntimeError, 'message'

  # good - signals a RuntimeError by default
  raise 'message'
  ~~~

* Prefer supplying an exception class and a message as two separate arguments
  to `raise`, instead of an exception instance.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  raise SomeException.new('message')
  # Note that there is no way to do `raise SomeException.new('message'), backtrace`.

  # good
  raise SomeException, 'message'
  # Consistent with `raise SomeException, 'message', backtrace`.
  ~~~

* Do not return from an `ensure` block. If you explicitly return from a method
  inside an `ensure` block, the return will take precedence over any exception
  being raised, and the method will return as if no exception had been raised at
  all. In effect, the exception will be silently thrown away.

  ~~~ ruby
  def foo
    raise
  ensure
    return 'very bad idea'
  end
  ~~~

* Use *implicit begin blocks* where possible.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  def foo
    begin
      # main logic goes here
    rescue
      # failure handling goes here
    end
  end

  # good
  def foo
    # main logic goes here
  rescue
    # failure handling goes here
  end
  ~~~

* Don't suppress exceptions.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  begin
    # an exception occurs here
  rescue SomeError
    # the rescue clause does absolutely nothing
  end

  # bad - `rescue nil` swallows all errors, including syntax errors, and
  # makes them hard to track down.
  do_something rescue nil
  ~~~

* Avoid using `rescue` in its modifier form.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad - this catches exceptions of StandardError class and its descendant classes
  read_file rescue handle_error($!)

  # good - this catches only the exceptions of Errno::ENOENT class and its descendant classes
  def foo
    read_file
  rescue Errno::ENOENT => error
    handle_error(error)
  end
  ~~~

* Avoid rescuing the `Exception` class.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  begin
    # calls to exit and kill signals will be caught (except kill -9)
    exit
  rescue Exception
    puts "you didn't really want to exit, right?"
    # exception handling
  end

  # good
  begin
    # a blind rescue rescues from StandardError, not Exception.
  rescue => error
    # exception handling
  end
  ~~~

* Favor the use of exceptions from the standard library over introducing new
  exception classes.

* Don't use single letter variables for exceptions (`error` isn't that hard to
  type).

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  begin
    # an exception occurs here
  rescue => e
    # exception handling
  end

  # good
  begin
    # an exception occurs here
  rescue => error
    # exception handling
  end
  ~~~


## Collections

* Prefer literal array and hash creation notation (unless you need to pass
  parameters to their constructors, that is).

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  arr = Array.new
  hash = Hash.new

  # good
  arr = []
  hash = {}
  ~~~

* Prefer `%w` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of words
  (non-empty strings without spaces and special characters in them).

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  STATES = ['draft', 'open', 'closed']

  # good
  STATES = %w(draft open closed)
  ~~~

* Prefer `%i` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of symbols.
  Apply this rule only to arrays with two or more elements.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  STATES = [:draft, :open, :closed]

  # good
  STATES = %i(draft open closed)
  ~~~

* When accessing the first or last element from an array, prefer `first` or
  `last` over `[0]` or `[-1]`.

* Avoid the use of mutable objects as hash keys.

* Use the Ruby 1.9 hash literal syntax when your hash keys are symbols.

* Don't mix the Ruby 1.9 hash syntax with hash rockets in the same hash literal.
  When you've got keys that are not symbols stick to the hash rockets syntax.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  { a: 1, 'b' => 2 }

  # good
  { :a => 1, 'b' => 2 }
  ~~~

* Use `Hash#key?` instead of `Hash#has_key?` and `Hash#value?` instead of
  `Hash#has_value?`. As noted
  [here](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/43765) by
  Matz, the longer forms are considered deprecated.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  hash.has_key?(:test)
  hash.has_value?(value)

  # good
  hash.key?(:test)
  hash.value?(value)
  ~~~

* Use `Hash#fetch` when dealing with hash keys that should be present.

  ~~~ ruby
  heroes = { batman: 'Bruce Wayne', superman: 'Clark Kent' }
  # bad - if we make a mistake we might not spot it right away
  heroes[:batman] # => "Bruce Wayne"
  heroes[:supermann] # => nil

  # good - fetch raises a KeyError making the problem obvious
  heroes.fetch(:supermann)
  ~~~

* Introduce default values for hash keys via `Hash#fetch` as opposed to using
  custom logic.

  ~~~ ruby
  batman = { name: 'Bruce Wayne', is_evil: false }

  # bad - if we just use || operator with falsy value we won't get the expected result
  batman[:is_evil] || true # => true

  # good - fetch work correctly with falsy values
  batman.fetch(:is_evil, true) # => false
  ~~~


## Strings

* Prefer string interpolation and string formatting instead of string
  concatenation:

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

  # good
  email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"

  # good
  email_with_name = format('%s <%s>', user.name, user.email)
  ~~~

* With interpolated expressions, there should be no padded-spacing inside the
  braces.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  "From: #{ user.first_name }, #{ user.last_name }"

  # good
  "From: #{user.first_name}, #{user.last_name}"
  ~~~

* Adopt a consistent string literal quoting style.

* Don't use the character literal syntax `?x`. Since Ruby 1.9 it's basically
  redundant - `?x` would interpreted as `'x'` (a string with a single character
  in it).

* Don't leave out `{}` around instance and global variables being interpolated
  into a string.

  ~~~ ruby
  class Person
    attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

    def initialize(first_name, last_name)
      @first_name = first_name
      @last_name = last_name
    end

    # bad - valid, but awkward
    def to_s
      "#@first_name #@last_name"
    end

    # good
    def to_s
      "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
    end
  end

  $global = 0
  # bad
  puts "$global = #$global"

  # fine, but don't use globals
  puts "$global = #{$global}"
  ~~~

* Don't use `Object#to_s` on interpolated objects. It's invoked on them
  automatically.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  message = "This is the #{result.to_s}."

  # good
  message = "This is the #{result}."
  ~~~

* Don't use `String#gsub` in scenarios in which you can use a faster more
  specialized alternative.

  ~~~ ruby
  url = 'http://example.com'
  str = 'lisp-case-rules'

  # bad
  url.gsub('http://', 'https://')
  str.gsub('-', '_')
  str.gsub('case', '')

  # good
  url.sub('http://', 'https://')
  str.tr('-', '_')
  str.delete('case')
  ~~~

* When using heredocs for multi-line strings keep in mind the fact that they
  preserve leading whitespace. It's a good practice to employ some margin based
  on which to trim the excessive whitespace.

  ~~~ ruby
  code = <<-END.gsub(/^\s+\|/, '')
    |def test
    |  some_method
    |  other_method
    |end
  END
  # => "def test\n  some_method\n  other_method\nend\n"

  # In Rails you can use `#strip_heredoc` to achieve the same result
  code = <<-END.strip_heredoc
    def test
      some_method
      other_method
    end
  END
  # => "def test\n  some_method\n  other_method\nend\n"
  ~~~

## Regular expressions

* Don't use regular expressions if you just need plain text search in string:
  `string['text']`

* Use non-capturing groups when you don't use the captured result.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  /(first|second)/

  # good
  /(?:first|second)/
  ~~~

* Don't use the cryptic Perl-legacy variables denoting last regexp group
  matches (`$1`, `$2`, etc). Use `Regexp#match` instead.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  /(regexp)/ =~ string
  process $1

  # good
  /(regexp)/.match(string)[1]
  ~~~

* Avoid using numbered groups as it can be hard to track what they contain.
  Named groups can be used instead.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  /(regexp)/ =~ string
  ...
  process Regexp.last_match(1)

  # good
  /(?<meaningful_var>regexp)/ =~ string
  ...
  process meaningful_var
  ~~~

* Be careful with `^` and `$` as they match start/end of line, not string
  endings.  If you want to match the whole string use: `\A` and `\z` (not to be
  confused with `\Z` which is the equivalent of `/\n?\z/`).

  ~~~ ruby
  string = "some injection\nusername"
  string[/^username$/]   # matches
  string[/\Ausername\z/] # doesn't match
  ~~~


## Percent Literals

* Use `%()`(it's a shorthand for `%Q`) for single-line strings which require
  both interpolation and embedded double-quotes. For multi-line strings, prefer
  heredocs.

* Avoid `%q` unless you have a string with both `'` and `"` in it. Regular
  string literals are more readable and should be preferred unless a lot of
  characters would have to be escaped in them.

* Use `%r` only for regular expressions matching *at least* one '/'
  character.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  %r{\s+}

  # good
  %r{^/(.*)$}
  %r{^/blog/2011/(.*)$}
  ~~~

* Avoid the use of `%s`. Use `:"some string"` to create a symbol with spaces in
  it.

* Prefer `()` as delimiters for all `%` literals, except `%r`. Since parentheses
  often appear inside regular expressions in many scenarios a less common
  character like `{` might be a better choice for a delimiter, depending on the
  regexp's content.


## Testing

* Treat test code like any other code you write. This means: keep readability,
  maintainability, complexity, etc. in mind.

* Minitest is the preferred test framework.

* A test case should only test a single aspect of your code.

* A good test case consists of three parts:
    1. Setup of the environment
    2. The action that is the subject of the test
    3. Asserting that the action did what you expect it do to.

  Consider separating these parts by a newline for readability, especially
  when your environment setup is complicated and you want to run multiple
  assertions afterwards.

  ~~~ ruby
  test 'sending a password reset email clears the password hash and set a reset token' do
    user = User.create!(email: 'bob@example.com')
    user.mark_as_verified

    user.send_password_reset_email

    assert_nil user.password_hash
    refute_nil user.reset_token
  end
    ~~~

* A complex test should be split into multiple simpler tests that test
  functionality in isolation.

* Prefer using `test 'foo'`-style syntax to define test cases over
  `def test_foo`.

* Prefer using assertion methods that will yield a more descriptive error
  message.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  assert user.valid?
  assert user.name == 'tobi'


  # good
  assert_predicate user, :valid?
  assert_equal 'tobi', user.name
  ~~~

* Avoid using `assert_nothing_raised`. Use a positive assertion instead.

* Prefer using assertions over expectations. Expectations lead to more brittle
  tests, especially in combination with singleton objects.

  ~~~ ruby
  # bad
  StatsD.expects(:increment).with('metric')
  do_something

  # good
  assert_statsd_increment('metric') do
    do_something
  end
  ~~~

## The rest

* Avoid long methods.

* Avoid long parameter lists.

* Use `def self.method` to define singleton methods.

* Avoid needless metaprogramming.

* Never start a method with `get_`.

* Never use a `!` at the end of a method name if you have no equivalent method
  without the bang. Methods are expected to change internal object state; you
  don't need a bang for that. Bangs are to mark a more dangerous version of a
  method, e.g. `save` returns a `bool` in ActiveRecord, whereas `save!` will
  throw an exception on failure.

* Avoid using `update_all`. If you do use it, use a scoped association
  (`Shop.where(amount: nil).update_all(amount: 0)`) instead of the two-argument
  version (`Shop.update_all({amount: 0}, amount: nil)`). But seriously, you
